    <h4><center>Iceland</center></h4>
    <p>Iceland is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice coexists.
    Where winter is offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich
    and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p class"message">The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora,
          and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april,
          Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.</p>

        <p class"message">The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the
          Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted
          by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field.
          This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across
          the skies.</p>

        <p class"message">When making a trip to Iceland,
          it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake—namely, its 4,500
          square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and
          takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of
          Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík
          (and Skaftafell).</p>
