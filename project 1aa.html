        <p>Iceland is a country of sharp constrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist.
          Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has supurred a rich and vibrant culture. </p>

          <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.
            From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent
            lightshow. <br> The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when
            particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, cuasing
            peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

          <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of
            glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the
            Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell).</p>
